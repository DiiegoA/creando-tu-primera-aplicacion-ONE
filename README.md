## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to provide beginner-friendly examples to help understand core Java concepts. The project includes topics like:

- Data types
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Casting between types
- Basic input/output with `Scanner`

Each file explores a different concept, from basic printing of messages to working with user inputs and decision-making logic.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following Java files:

### Description of Files:

1. **App.java**:
   - Prints "Hello, World!" to the console. It is a traditional entry point for beginners.
2. **Apuntes.java**:
   - Contains detailed notes and comments on the basic structure and types in Java (JVM, JDK, JRE, data types, etc.).
3. **Decisiones.java**:
   - Demonstrates how to make decisions in Java using `if-else` statements and how to collect user input using `Scanner`.
4. **Ejercicios.java**:
   - Exercises focused on processing user inputs, including movie ratings and release dates.
5. **Evaluaciones.java**:
   - Similar to Ejercicios, with additional examples of user input processing, but with greater emphasis on evaluations.
6. **JavaCreandoTuPrimeraApp.java**:

   - An introduction file that guides through the process of creating your first Java app.

7. **Lectura.java**:
   - Deals with reading input from users, specifically movie-related data, though the file appears to have been truncated.
8. **Loops.java**:
   - Example demonstrating how to use loops (`for`) to gather multiple ratings from the user and calculate an average.
9. **Main.java**:
   - A slightly more advanced example where the program displays information about the movie _Matrix_, including its synopsis, release date, and ratings. Also includes type casting examples.
10. **PrimerraClase.java**:
    - A celebratory file that simply prints a message about completing the first Java class.
